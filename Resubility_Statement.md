# Reusibility Statement

---

We wish to argue that our artifact (SetDroid) should receive an "Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable" badge based on the following points.

* SetDroid is a fully automated, end-to-end GUI testing tool for finding system setting-related defects in Android apps. A user can simply run SetDroid on a given app via command lines, and SetDroid will automatically detect likely setting defects and outputs the corresponding bug reports. To ease bug confirmation, SetDroid provides visual bug
reports.

* SetDroid is comprehensively documented in README, and Section 2.5 ("Tool Extension") describes several plausible scenarios on how to extend, customize and improve SetDroid.

* The artifact contains all the source code of SetDroid and the virtual machine image (everything is set up). A user can directly use and extend SetDroid from the source code or the VM image. We also provide video tutorials on setting up the tool and illustrating the tool usage.

* The artifact contains the other documentations that describe the use case scenarios and other details of SetDroid. For example, it lists all the supported configuration options/strategies, explains the different types of the output files, and provides all the evaluation data in the original paper.

* SetDroid is well-designed and its source code is easy to understand with necessary comments.
